Angular2 Notes from the Mosh Tutorial

Components
- Root ( View ) Components
export class RatingComponent {
	//Angular2 Components are TypeScript (.ts) classes
	//There can be both properties and methods in TypeScript classes

	//Variables are declared inside TypeScript (.ts) classes; Properties hold the data of the view
	averageRating: number;

	//Methods hold the behavior rules for the view
	setRating(value) {
		//some type of formula, or code goes inside a set of method curly braces
	}
}

Directives
- are built in helpers
<input type="text" autoGrow />
Routers
Services

<h4>Angular2 Forms</h4>
<p>Autocomplete and Novalidate are two Html5 factions that deal with Form Validation.</p>
<p>Please disable these two Html5 functions when dealing with the construction of forms in Angular2, as follows:</p>

<form autocomplete="off" novalidate>
	<fieldset>
		<legend>Summary</legend>
		<div class="form-field">
			<label>Title:</label>
			<input name="title" [(ngModel)]="lesson.title" required minlength="10">
		//ngModel is a helper based on many Directives
		//Here, the 'required' directive forces the user to input, and the 'minlength' forces validity of at least ten (10) typed characters by the end-user
		</div>

	</fieldset>
</form>


<h5>Bi-directional Data binding </h5>
<p>Bi-directional Data binding can be as simple as plucking the data from a form after the user completes an input.</p>
