  <h4>Trump's Voodoo Inflationary Economics Will Doom The American Economy</h4>
</hgroup>
  <hr class='green-groove' />

<p>
  <span>Trump's tax cuts coupled with a crimp in labor supply, as well as a crimp in other supply side components such as investable capital ...</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Will lead to an uptick in inflation that will quickly deflate the equity and bond markets as we currently know them to be.</span>.
</p>

<hgroup class='text-left'>
  <h4>The more things change ...</h4>
</hgroup>
  <hr class='green-groove' />

<p>
  <span>In 1920, taxes were considered 'high".</span>
  <span>So, there was a political push by the interlockig directorates of the day ( similar to today ) to cut taxes.</span>
</p> 
  
<p>
  <span>As a result, expect an increase in the hoarding and speculation of hard commodities such as gold, land and real estate as we balloon further our already disastrous $20 trillion USD ( on-the-books ) gross deficit,</span>
</p>   

<p>
  <span>Further, by rearranging the consumption habits of over 150 million American households to the detriment of retail, not a single $1 dollar more of marginal tax revenue will be generated for the government as Art Laffer curve enthusiasts still religiously recant even today after all of the REAL evidence that suggests otherwise, including President Reagan's own experience that still resonates throughout the ages to this day.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>On the contrary, given the unfolding scenario of lower taxes set to begin by the start of fiscal #2018 ...</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The United States government is set to lose over 1/2 of what it currently raises in federal income taxes each and every April 15th going forward based on the current price elasticity of supply.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>All this at a time when the number of dollars needed by the government to pay the simple INTEREST on its debt portfolio silently snatches an even greater slice of the American pie each and every day.</span> 
</p>  

<p>
  <span>Do NOT look to the Federal Reserve to balloon its portfolio any more than it already has to compensate.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>It's no secret Janet Yellen and her board of regional governors already know they are way over funded at the Federal Reserve level after greasing the previous anemic Obama expansion to the tune of $4 Trillion USD both here and abroad.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>No, when the sh't hits the fan here in America people, the Federal Reserve will not be able to act other than to RETIRE rather than RE-ISSUE new debt.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>This known fact will suck investable capital ... a supply side component like labor ... right out of the economy.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>By clamping down on our supply of cheap foreign labor that by the way contributes around a quarter of all social security and medicare tax receipts WITHOUT the prospect of ever drawing from either, Trump has set the wheels of inflation spinning to the benefit of his multi-headed, and heavily indebted personal real estate related enterprises.</span>

	<h4>Money In, Money Out</h4>
</hgroup>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
	<span>The United States government receives around $2 Trillion dollars USD in total receipts annually.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Of this public money that comes into the government from various sources including the general income tax on both private and corporate income, around 12 1/2% or $250 billion dollars USD gets paid out in interest ...</span>  
</p>

<p>
  <span>With the country of China ( $100 billion ) being the largest beneficary of that government largesse.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Based on a lay person's understanding, the government could offer a powerball lottery each and every day of the year ( that's 365 days people! ) and still pay out a lump sum winning $500 million cash each and every day to the winners of each lottery ... </span> 
</p>

<p>  
  <span>And, still not cover the interest that is pissed away each and every day to the holders of our government debt annually.</span>
