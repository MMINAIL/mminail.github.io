<p>
  <span>A full eighty (80) years AFTER its initiation by fear-mongering, anti-color groups ...</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The same spew and tactics that originally placed hemp in the "illegal and dangerous" category a-way back during deliberations ...</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>For the then, now infamous, and since deemed unconstitutional ... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leary_v._United_States" title="Click to Review the landmark case of Leary v United States" target="_blank">Marijuana Stamp Act of '37</a> ... that was then placed on President Roosevelt's desk!</span> 
</p>

<p>
  <span>For which he then signed into law!</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>"Arizona is still a place where common sense works", said Governor Ducey when addressing the crowd at the <b>S.A.M.</b> convention.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>But, where was this convention being held while our State Senators and State Representatives were in a PAID session here in Arizona a-hammering out our hemp farming bill?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The convention, and by extension Governor Ducey ... went AWOL in Atlanta, GEORGIA!</span>

  <span>What the hell was our Arizona governor doing at a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alysonmartin/marijuana-wont-make-america-great-again-420-critics">Pot Prohibition</a> rally in Atlanta, GEORGIA on April 20th, #2017 ( aka 4/20 ) during a PAID legislative session out west here at home, as reported by our friends over at <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/news" title="Click to Review Buzz Feed News" target="_blank">Buzz Feed News</a> ???</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Who in the hell paid for the Governor's trip to Atlanta?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Was this financed with public money during a PAID legislative session?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Or, did the Governor pay for this trip from the almost $8,000 per month salary he earns FROM THE VOTERS OF ARIZONA for running the Executive branch of our Great State?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Was the Governor's trip to Atlanta, GEORGIA financed with "Hush Money" from Prohibitive proponents such as Chandler based, <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/arizona-drug-firm-insys-makes-synthetic-pot-compound-spends-big-to-defeat-legal-pot-8628614">Arizona Insys</a>?</span>

   <span>A-la Donald Trump of New York @<a href="https://twitter.com/learnaboutsam">learnaboutsam</a> run by small potatoes CEO Kevin Sabet "for your work on this critical issue".</span>

  <span>Governor Ducey says he does this stodgy, old, misguided and now thoroughly debunked "Prohibition thing" ... "for the children".</span>

<p>
  <span>During an EXPENSIVE trip to the home territories of the Ku Klux Klan and now US Attorney General Jeff Beauregard Sessions?</span>

<p>

  <h4>Congressional Support</h4>

  <hr class='green-groove' />

</p>

<p>
  <span>Yet, the Governor still decided to PRIVATELY VETO the legislation!</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Fact</b>.</span>
  <span>On Friday, May 5th, #2017 ... <a href='http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/bills/sb1337s.pdf' title='Click to Review the Full Text of the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017' target='_blank'>SB 1337</a> passed the Arizona State Senate with a unanimous vote of twenty-nine (29) 'yea' votes, ZERO 'nay' votes, and one (1) State Senator John Kavanagh present, a Republican from Arizona State Legislative District #23 representing the City of Fountain Hills, but who choose NOT TO VOTE, thus registering a rare 'NV'.</span>

  <h4>The Roll Call</h4>
</hgroup>
  <hr class='green-groove' />

<p> 
  <span>What transpires next is the alphabetical roll-call result from the Friday, May 5th, #2017 Arizona State Senate vote that catapulted <a href='http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/bills/sb1337s.pdf' title='Click to Review the Full Text of the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017' target='_blank'>SB 1337</a> onto Arizona Governor Ducey's desk for signature ... or, for as in this case ... a VETO ...!</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Full Disclosure</b>.</span>
  <span>Sixteen (16) years ago, in March of #2001 ... State Senator Borrelli was convicted locally of one count of Domestic Violence stemming from an altercation with his now ex-wife.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>After pleading guilty to a lesser offense as part of a plea bargain, State Senator Borrelli was sentenced to ten (10) days in jail, of which he served (1) day before being released under a court order of one-year of probation, plus a $400 fine with the stipulation that he successfully undergo Anger Management classes.</span> 
</p>

<p>
  <span>The court order has since elapsed after State Senator Borrelli complied with the terms of the order.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>No additional incidence of Domestic Violence alleged or otherwise has been incurred by State Senator Borrelli over the fifteen (15) year period of time since his release and divorce.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>State Senator Lisa Otondo from Arizona State Legislative District #4 representing Yuma, the other bi-partisan co-sponsor of <a href='http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/bills/sb1337s.pdf' title='Click to Review the Full Text of the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017' target='_blank'>SB 1337</a> has no such record to disclose.</span>

  <h4>Senatorial Salaries</h4>
</hgroup>
  <hr class='green-groove' />

<p>
  <span>Each of the (90) members of the Arizona State Congress earns a $24,000 annual salary in performance of their duties.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Both in session, and out of session ... it doesn't matter ... each State Senator earns his $24,000 annual salary paid monthly.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Plus, various types of stipend reimbursements that are allowed and paid on behalf of the State Senators are paid out under separate cover.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>But, not for trips to the STATE OF GEORGIA to address the Twitter crowds about raising money for HEMP PROHIBITION, the very item your STATE SENATORS voted UNANIMOUSLY to pass!</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Now, the aggregate tab for just the salaries of Arizona's State Congressmen and Congresswomen is around $2 million dollars annually.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>That's right! (90) multiplied by $24,000 equals $2,160,000 USD.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>That's $2 million dollars, people!</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Do you feel like you are getting your money's worth?</span>

<p>
  <span>Did I mention, the Governor of Arizona also receives an annual salary of $95,000 USD, as well?</span>

<p>
  <span>You really can't put the blame on your favorite whipping boys and girls this time.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Fact</b>.</span>
  <span>Your Arizona State Senators have voted UNANIMOUSLY to allow Hemp Farming in Arizona!</span>

  <span>Specifically for the <a href='https://agriculture.az.gov/' title='Click To Review the Arizona Dept of Agriculture' target='_blank'>Arizona Dept of Agriculture</a> to carry out its duties that are spelled out within the now vetoed bill?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>So, why did you REALLY veto Senator Sonny's landmark legislation, Governor Ducey?</span>
</p>
  <hr class='green-groove' />

<hgroup class='text-left'>
  <h4>Scholaric - Scholeric</h4>
</hgroup>
  <hr class='green-groove' />

<p>
  <span>Was the legislation too PROGRESSIVE for your <a href='https://homeschoolconnectionsonline.com/homeschool-forms' title='Click To Review the term Scholaric - Scholeric mind' target='_blank'>Sclerotic</a> mind?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Governor Ducey, with or without you, industrial hemp is a great boon to Arizona’s economy.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The fact that you have failed to perform your duty as Governor is glaring.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017 commonly known as <a href='http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/bills/sb1337s.pdf' title='Click to Review the Full Text of the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017' target='_blank'>SB 1337</a> is NOT a boondoggle as your 'head-in-the-sand' compatriots who always seem to run for cover claiming false and fictitious reasons for NOT supporting the growing of hemp in Arizona do expound!</span>
</p>


<p>
  <span>But, HERE in the Great State of ARIZONA ... HERE in this case... Your fellow Trifecta dominated Republican legislature SENT YOU THIS BILL for your approval signature.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Yet, you could not perform this one simple task!</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>And, in the process, or the "anti-process" you SH'T all over the prominent members of your own political party, the #GOP.</span> 
</p>

<p>
  <span>Now, DIDN'T you Governor Ducey?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Your decision to VETO the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017 commonly known as <a href='http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/bills/sb1337s.pdf' title='Click to Review the Full Text of the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017' target='_blank'>SB 1337</a> will result in LESS job creation, and will lead to LESS opportunity for our Arizona small business farmers and patients, now won't it, Governor Ducey?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Did you even <a href="http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/bills/sb1337s.pdf" title="Click to Review the Full Text of the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017" target="_blank">READ</a> the <b>Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017</b> commonly known as <a href='http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/bills/sb1337s.pdf' title='Click to Review the Full Text of the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017' target='_blank'>SB 1337</a>, Governor Ducey?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>For if you did, you would know ...</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The bill clearly states in the following Preamble ...</span>
</p>
  <hr class='green-groove' />

<hgroup class='text-left'>
  <h4>SB 1337 Preamble</h4>
</hgroup>
  <hr class='green-groove' />

<p>
  <span>"THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND DETERMINES THAT THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP CAN IMPROVE THE ECONOMY AND AGRICULTURAL VITALITY OF THIS STATE AND THAT THE PRODUCTION OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP CAN BE REGULATED SO AS NOT TO INTERFERE WITH STRICT REGULATION OF MARIJUANA IN THIS STATE."</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Well, it's now too late for you to reconsider your position on this issue and to return to work with our elected Senators and Representatives to bring this important new economic driver to our Great State of Arizona.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>But, I have to ask you Governor ... Which State do you now currently represent?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>For which State are you the CURRENT elected Executive, Governor Ducey?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>People, farmers, voters, patients and your fellow government officials WILL NOT ALL remember this fateful decision of yours to VETO State Senator Borrelli's and State Senator Otondo's bi-partisan <b>Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017</b>, commonly known as <a href='http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/bills/sb1337s.pdf' title='Click to Review the Full Text of the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017' target='_blank'>SB 1337</a> ...</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>But, a lot of them will!</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>When it is time for you to come to call for MONEY to get yourself Re-elected at the November #2018 General Election, we will remember this VETO and the slap in the face you have given ALL hard-working Arizonans!</span>

  <h4>Roll Call Vote</h4>

  <hr class='green-groove' />

<p>
  <span>For your perusal, Governor Ducey ... Here is the list of Arizona State Senators that unanimously voted FOR <a href='http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1R/bills/sb1337s.pdf' title='Click to Review the Full Text of the Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017' target='_blank'>SB 1337</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The lone exception, as mentioned above, being State Senator Kavanagh of Fountain Hills who was present, but simply refrained from voting ... Thus, earning a "not voting", or "nv" designation next to his name during the roll call vote.</span>

<p>
  <span>Hello State Senator [ NAME ]:</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>I am sorry to hear our morally corrupt Governor Ducey failed to sign your wonderful, bipartisan, overwhelmingly approved SB 1337 commonly known as the <b>Arizona Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017</b>.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Not to worry, though. Your friends in the digital press have your back.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>We are going to light up the entire nation to the fallacy that Governor Ducey has demonstrated he is ...</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>By vetoing your fine piece of collaborative work?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Who in his or her right mind punts a piece of legislation that the entire STATE SENATE endorsed?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>For the nitty gritty behind the scenes view of the events that led up to his VETO of YOUR legislation, please check out the subject article our team has written about the affair now available for instant download at our working repository at GitHub.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Thank you again for your superb effort, State Senator [ NAME ].</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>With the #GOP currently splintered nationally over the crisis at the White House in Washington, DC ...</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>It is nice to see you all working together here at the capitol in Arizona to achieve a common goal for us all.</span>
