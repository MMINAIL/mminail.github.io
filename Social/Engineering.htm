<p>
<span><b>Fact</b>.</span>
<span>Americans are fundamentally wired from birth to respond to the Cannabis plant.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>Cannabis helps regulate the human Endocannabinoid System, or <a href="http://medmj.us/Endocannabinoids" title="Click to Review the Human Endocannabinoid System" target="_blank">ECS</a> by adhering to receptors in each thinking neuron of the brain.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
<span>By adhering to the receptors located at the apex of the dendrite of the neuron, Cannabis plant phytocannabinoids help regulate the neurotransmitters responsible for the accentuated feelings of anxiety, remorse, and fear that are caused by perceptions of unreal manifestations of reality experienced by the over-reactive members of our societal niches.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
<span>One "knee-jerk" reaction to the Cannabis plant is experienced by Prohibitionists set by the <b>Social Engineering</b> efforts of the past that epigenetically and politically pass on from one generation to the next an abject fear of the natural medicines, terpenes, and cannabinoids produced by the plant.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
<span>That is why, under the auspicion of native, familial - tribal protectionism and groupthink, even after thirteen (13) successive changes of political White House administrations from Roosevelt to Trump we still have the plant technically illegal under a Federal statute enacted by a congress-past chock full of recipients of "Big Pharma", "Big Timber", and "Big Oil" political donations.</span>
<p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
<span>Never has such a detrimental hoax been socially engineered upon the American people to direct American money to targets conducive to losing 20,000 "guinea pig" lives per annum when contrasted with the ZERO fatalities of stashes past.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
<span>Why then is Cannabis still illegal to grow in America, whereas the Tobacco plant is not?</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>Look no further than the last <a href="http://cookpolitical.com/story/10201" title="Click to Review the General Election of November 2016 Through The Lens of The Cook Report" target="_blank">General Election of November #2016</a> through the lens of the Cook Report that saw the rise of President Trump and the demise of legal grows for patients throughout the Great State of Arizona.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span><b>Answer</b>.</span>
<span>In President Trump's own words, an easily swayed chunk of the populace spread across many Arizonan counties that in effect hurridly threw the "baby out with the bathwater" at the beheast of their GOP "masters" by voting down #RecMj in Az in Nov #2016 to the detriment of all unfortunate medical patients that reside within (25) miles of a branch of the rapacious medical marijuana dispensary tax machine of Arizona.</span>

<p>
<span>If you would like to help us overturn this archaic and detrimental (25) mile rule for medical patients in Arizona, then please give generously to the Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
	<span>Your donation will help spur change at the State Legislature and to help fund future initiatives that may then be placed at the foot of the voters of Arizona's thirteen (13) counties for ultimate decision.</span>
