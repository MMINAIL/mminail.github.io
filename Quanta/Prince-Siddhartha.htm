	<h4>Evil Quanta</h4>
</hgroup>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
    <span>Speaking 500 years before the Birth of The Christ, The Buddha was able to glimpse the quantum world of the very small when stating ... "All conditional phenomenon are impermanent."</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>When two particles are entangled in a state of superposition in the quantum world granting, for example, oscillating spins of different direction, their phenomenon, this spooky action at a distance as described by Albert Einstein, is conditional upon observation.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>For upon observation and interaction with the realm of the universe, the "evil quanta" of Einstein's daydreams and thought experiments collapse to reveal a now impermanent representation of what previously was a conditional phenomenon.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Each quanta possesses a wave function that describes the potential possible many states of each particle ... when observed.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Upon observation the quanta becomes set and subject to the universal laws of decay and thermodynamics.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Hence the statement by the Buddha, "All conditional phenomenon are impermanent."</span>

    <span><b>Given</b>.</span>
    <span>The ultimate conversion of energy from a Direct Current (DC) electron to the more usable Alternating Current (AC) of our household appliances and vehicles is desired.</span>

<p>
    <span><b>Issue</b>.</span>
    <span>Can an electron generated by a solar array that captures photons from the sun be tele-transported from one location to another via the super-position-path of two entangled quanta suspended in a state of superposition?</span>
