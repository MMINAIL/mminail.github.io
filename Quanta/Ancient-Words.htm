<p>
	<span>What are ancient words for, if no one listens?</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />
<p>
	<span>I am Tah-tahn-ka "<span lang="es" title="Sp. and ... Pronounced 'ee' in English"><em> y </em></span>" a Tahn-ka ... <a href="#" title="Click to Review The West by Ken Burns" target="_blank">Keeper of the Everywhere Spirit</a>.</span>
	<span>And, I offer you the vison of <em>Hah-la-too-keet</em> ... or, in English ... Good ... "Day Time Smoke".</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Join in our effort today to support the many unfortunate patients living inside the twenty-five (25) mile radius restriction</span>
	<span>of a #<a href="htp://canabuds.us" title="Click to Review The Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited" target="_blank">MedMj</a> dispensary in Arizona.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Why? You may ask ... Are these patients unfortunate?</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Because they are FORCED by legislative market dictates to pay for the flowers of their medicinal plants.</span>

	<h4>Sunshine Galore</h4>
</hgroup>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
    <span><b>Fact</b>.</span>
	<span>Arizona receives over 300+ days of full sunshine per year.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Patients can easily grow their own medicine plants in the comfort of their own backyard using solar panels.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>These solar panels are designed to maximize the intense output of the Sun's rays through the desert atmosphere, throughout the year, day in and day out.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>But, the state legislature refuses to grant this right to its medical patients, opting to consume tremendous amounts of fossil fuel derived electricity to power the indoor grow units of its dispensary cartel.</span>
