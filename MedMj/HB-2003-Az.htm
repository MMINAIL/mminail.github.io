    <h4>Marijuana Prohibition</h4>
</hgroup>
    <hr class='green-groove' />

<p>
    <span>We all know Marijuana Prohibition ( <abbr class='oblique-text' title='Marijuana Prohibition'>MP</abbr> ) has failed.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Marijuana Prohibition ( <abbr class='oblique-text' title='Marijuana Prohibition'>MP</abbr> ) has been traditionally selectively enforced.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>This selective enforcement disproportionately affects communities of minorities, as well as many new, rapidly evolving communities of elderly folks.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Creating an underclass of individuals who can have their lives ruined by a felony conviction for the benefit of Arizona's private prison complex is no way to spend your twilight years.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Marijuana Prohibition ( <abbr class='oblique-text' title='Marijuana Prohibition'>MP</abbr> ) also diverts law enforcement resources from serious crimes to the "low hanging fruits" of Cannabis persecution.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>As a result, a litany of murders, rapes, and burglaries remain UNDER-investigated.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>When law enforcement no longer wastes time on arresting people of minority communities, as well as the elderly for felonious marijuana violations, resources will be released to target more serious crimes.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Marijuana Prohibition ( <abbr class='oblique-text' title='Marijuana Prohibition'>MP</abbr> ) is coming to an end sooner than you may think across America.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>I hope you will be a part of the solution today, rather than pushing the issue further on down the line.</span>
