  <h3>How does a Missouri Qualified Patient, or MQP obtain a Missouri Medical Marijuana "ID" Card</h3>
</hgroup>
  <hr class="green-groove" />

<h4>Process</h4>

<p>
  <span><b>Step 1</b>: You must first visit, dependent upon your medical condition, either an official State-Licensed Physician (SL-PHY) or an official State-Licensed Psychiatrist (SL-PSY) in order to obtain an official Physician Certification (P-Cert) to be presented to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (MO DHSS) with your application.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Note</b>. A simple signature from a Nurse Practitioner (NP) or a Physician Assistant (PA) is NOT sufficient.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Note</b>. The #P-Cert must be issued and signed by either an official #SL-PHY or an official #SL-PSY dependent upon your medical condition.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Step 2</b>: You must apply for a Missouri Medical Marijuana "ID" Card starting on July 4, 2019</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Note 2a</b>. The cost for the Missouri Medical Marijuana "ID" Card is $25</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Step 3</b>: Once your application is approved by the DHSS and you have received your Missouri Medical Marijuana "ID" Card in the mail, then you may then purchase #MedMj from any Missouri State-Licensed Dispensary (MSLD).</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Note</b>. The first Missouri State-Licensed Dispensary, or MSLD under the new Article XIV of the Missouri Constitution is not expected to open until January 1, 2020</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Note</b>. Interstate transportation of Medical Marijuana, or #MedMj into the State of Missouri from another state is prohibited under current US Federal Law.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span><b>Note</b>. The Intrastate purchase of #MedMj from a non-MSLD entity such as a street dealer or other Black Market Participant (BMP) is also prohibited under State of Missouri law.</span>
