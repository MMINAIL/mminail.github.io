<h4>Dear Donor:</h4>

<p>
	<span>To donate to the Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited, an Arizona Benefit Corporation ...</span>
	<span>Simply follow this link to our <a href="https://www.cash.me/$MMINAIL" title="Click to Donate To The Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited, an Arizona Benefit Corporation via Square Up - Cash Me" target="_blank">Square Up - Cash Me</a>&nbsp;page.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Then, <kbd>enter</kbd> the amount of your contribution and the source of your donation.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>You may also donate used or "like new" college text books.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Simply ship the books to our address mentioned below and we will return a list of your books received.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>The current market value of your contrbution at the time of your donation will be based upon ...</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>The then current supply and demand, and the prices offered for comparable college text books at the <a href="#" title="Click to Visit the Hempazonia Advantage Book Store at Amazon" target="_blank">Hempazonia Advantage Book Store</a> at Amazon.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>As we have opted not to petition the IRS for a revenue exempt 501(c)3 designation ...</span>
	<span>But, rather have set up a new Benefit Corporation in 2015 to allow for the receipt of funds from the public as fully taxable donation revenue,
	<span>our efforts may be disbursed liberally without consideration of tax ramification.</span></p>

<p>
	</span>As a Benefit Corporation, our charter may be pointed in either direction.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>As a for-profit enterprise, but at the same time, as a general public benefit serving the interests of the medical patient community.</span>
</p>

<p>
	</span>Your donation will further our effort globally to re-establish the once dominant profile of our nation's most treasured medicinal plants.</span>
</p>

<p>
	</span>Thank you for your donation.</span>
