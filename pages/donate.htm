</p>

<p>
	<span>Simply ship the books to our address listed below and we will return a list of your books received.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
	<span>The current market value of your contrbution at the time of your donation will be based upon the then current supply and demand, and the prices offered for comparable college text books at the <a href="#" title="Click to Visit the Advantage Book Store at Amazon" target="_blank">Advantage Book Store</a> of Amazon dot com.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
	<span>As we have opted not to petition the IRS for a revenue exempt 501(c)3 designation but, rather have set up a new Benefit Corporation in 2015 to allow for the receipt of funds from the public ( as fully taxable donation revenue ) our efforts may be disbursed liberally without consideration of tax ramification.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
	</span>As a Benefit Corporation, our charter may be pointed in either direction.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>As a for-profit enterprise, but at the same time, as a general public benefit serving the interests of the medical patient community.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
	</span>Your donation will further our effort globally to re-establish the once dominant profile of our nation's most treasured medicinal plants.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />
<p>
	</span>Thank you for your donation.</span>
