<p>
	<span>Welcome! This is the Privacy Policy page of the <b>Carbon Free Footprint</b> project.</span>

  </p>

  <p>
    <span>The '<b>Carbon Free Footprint</b>' project originally started out as a news and information company, and as such operates the above subject website.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>The passing of the AMA of 2010 with help of the <a href="https://www.mpp.org" title="Click to Visit the MPP website" target="_blank">MPP</a> by the voters of Arizona in 2010 enabled the</span>
    <a href="http://www.azdhs.gov/medicalmarijuana/" title="" target="_blank">Arizona Dept of Health and Human Services</a> to issue patient-user ID "green" cards with the optional '<b>Authority To Cultivate</b>' stamped on the front of the AzDES issued "green" card.</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    <span>The '<b>Carbon Free Footprint</b>' project advocates for a return of the patients' right to cultivate using solar energy that was stripped from us at the advent of the opening of expensive medical dispensaries in the State of Arizona away back in the year 2011.</span>
