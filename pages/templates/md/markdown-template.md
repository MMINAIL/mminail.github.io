## The Flammarion

The **Flammarion** is an ancient portrait of a medieval man poking his head into the ether beyond the then given celestial sphere upon which all planets traversed guided and pulled by Apollo's all powerful Sun Chariot.

The last full eclipse of the sun across America occurred in the year #1979 prior to the ascent of the social darkness of Ronald Reagan's conservative movement.

The ancient Meso-Americans considered an eclipse to be a "bad omen" such that Columbus while shipwrecked on his 3rd voyage to the New World used his knowledge of the occurrences of solar eclipses to extract concessions from the natives.

"If you don't give me and my crew some food, I will cause the sun to stop shining!"~ Christopher Columbus, circa 1500

Quite a display of astronomical prowess, heh?
