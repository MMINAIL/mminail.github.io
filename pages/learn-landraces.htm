<h4>Learn Landraces</h4>

<p>
	<span>The Landrace Subdirectory serves up a menu of Landrace articles for the <b>Carbon Free Footprint</b> project.</span>
</p>
  <hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
  <span>Here, the root file serves with css out of the pages directory below.</span>
</p>
  <hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
  <span>But, sorry! We are not able to serve css one level beyond the pages directory into the Landrace Subdirectory at this time.</span>
</p>
  <hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
  <span>As soon as we patch the relative path to the other Landrace files in the Landrace folder at ../pages/landraces ...</span>
  <span>We will lift the restriction.</span>
