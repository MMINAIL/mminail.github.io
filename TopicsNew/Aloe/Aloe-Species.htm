Aloe 33 (perryi)
This aloe specie is hardy to 33 degrees F. or just above 0 degrees Celsius due to thinner leaves and a corresponding diminished water-gel volume

The English word aloe is derived from the Arabic word "alloeh" which means "bitter". When tasting the gel of the plant from the inner caverns of the protruding and producing leaves, a clarity of sulphur (polysaccharides) can be detected by the taste buds due to the bitter yet beneficial liquid found in the leaves. Think "castor" oil without all of the hype. The benefits of the aloe plant are very subtle, but also very powerful when ingested whole. In addition to the lubricate qualities of the juice, embedded in the plant are also the following list of micronutrients: 20 minerals, 18 amino acids and 12 vitamins.
