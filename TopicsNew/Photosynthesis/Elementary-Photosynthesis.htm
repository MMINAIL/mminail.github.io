<h2>Elementary Photosynthesis 101</h2>

<h4>The Basic Molecular Formula of Angiosperm Photosynthesis</h4>

Formula: 6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2 (Carbon dioxide plus water yields sugar and oxygen)

Each 'parenchyma' cell embedded within a leaf can contains anywhere from ten to one-hundred 'chloroplast' (bundles of endosymbiotic light absorbing proteins called 'organelles').

In turn, each 'chloroplast' has its own mini 'plastome' of DNA, the duty of which is to code for the redox proteins involved in the transport of electrons throughout the process of photosynthesis.

Because the 'plastome' of a chloroplast is genetically transferred to the following generation via the female flower, and not via the male pollen, biological containment of transgenic plastids have been observed in transplastomic plants at failure rates as low as 3/Million.

Nature, apparantly, does trully find a way out of such efforts to contain it.

For example, many of the genes that code for other proteins involved in the photosynthesis process of a plant are no longer even resident on the plastome, but have 'jumped' or have been developed onto the chromosomes of the female gamete.

Throughout the larger leaf complex, particularly in the 'parenchyma' cells that make up the central 'mesophyll' area of the leaf, chloroplast density can range between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf!

In the leaf, photons of primarily visible light are captured by the chloroplasts and then converted into energy storage packets ie) ATP and NADPH.

ATP and NADPH are then utilized by the plant to split both the carbon dioxide molecule and the water molecule into usable sugars and oxygen.

There are two distinct reaction center chlorophylls, named P680 and P700 after the wavelength (in nanometers) of their resepective red-peak absorption maximums.

Dubbed 'chlorophyll A' and 'chlorophyll B', the chemical makeup of each chlorophyll differs by only two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom ie) 'C55H72O5N4Mg' and 'C55H70O6N4Mg'.

In other words, both have similar chlorin rings at their centers dominated by a central magnesium ion enveloped by a cluster of four nitrogen ions with slight peripheral changes in the number of free hydrogen and oxygen ions that cling to a rather uniform carbon skeleton.

The slight resultant change in the ability of each type of chlorphyll to resonate and thus transfer an electron down the chain of photosynthetic events gives each chloropyll it's own sweet spot on the visible light spectrum, not too distant from each other in terms of namometers, in and around the far-red area of the visible light spectrum.

Up front on the visible light spectrum, each type of chlorophyll also correspondingly peaks at slightly different blue readings, as well, with limited absorption thereafter throughout the balance of the visible light spectrum, though even accepting a limited amount of ultra-violet wawelengths, too.

Chlorophyll B is almost identical to chlorophyll A except it has a formyl group in place of a methyl group.

This small difference makes chlorophyll B absorb light with wavelengths between 400 and 500 nm more efficiently

In addition to chlorophyll, minor auxiliary light absorbing pigments that have their own spectral sweet spots, most notably 'carotenoids', do also exist in the leaf cells.

Indeed, 'carotenoids' appear to perform a secondary function, as well.

'Carotenoids' suppress certain other damaging photo-chemical reactions, in particular those including oxygen, that can be induced by extraordinarily bright bursts of sunlight.

Laboratory tests have shown that plants lacking 'carotenoids' do quickly die upon exposure to light and oxygen.

Two examples of 'carotenoids' are lycopene and β-carotene.

These molecules absorb light most efficiently in the 400 – 500 nm range.

Due to their absorption region, 'carotenoids' appear red and yellow and provide most of the red and yellow colours present in fruits and flowers.

The veins are the vascular tissue of the leaf and are located in the spongy layer of the mesophyll. They are typical examples of pattern formation through ramification. The pattern of the veins is called venation.
The veins are made up of:
Xylem: tubes that bring water and minerals from the roots into the leaf.
Phloem: tubes that usually move sap, with dissolved sucrose, produced by photosynthesis in the leaf, out of the leaf.
The xylem typically lies on the adaxial side of the vascular bungle and the phloem typically lies on the abaxial side. Both are embedded in a dense parenchyma tissue, called the pith or sheath, which usually includes some structural collenchyma tissue.
