	<h4>Home Brew'd Terms</h4>
</hgroup>
	<hr class='green-groove' />

<p>
	<span>In Homebrew, a 'Formula' is a package definition written in Ruby otherwise commonly known as a binary archive.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Whereas, a 'Bottle' in Homebrew is defined as a pre-built 'Keg'.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>As an option to building from source, the 'Bottle', or pre-compiled binary package may simply be un-zip'd and allowed to propagate through the system at default.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Whereas, the 'Keg' is defined as the installation 'pre-fix' of a 'Formula'.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>All 'Keg'(s), by the way, are installed in the 'Cellar' subdirectory of the Homebrew <code>/usr/local/</code> pathway.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Interestingly, as anathema to Homebrew as the primary <code>/opt/local/</code> pathway used by Macports is, Homebrew places its symbolic links in the /opt/ subdirectory of the /usr/local/ pathway defining the procedure as the 'opt prefix'!</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Finally, 'Tap'(s) in Homebrew are Git repos house'd under the main <code>/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/</code> thread.</span>
