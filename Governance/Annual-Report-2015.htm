<p>
	<span>Time and Place of Annual Meeting</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>9:00 pm MST; Tempe, Arizona USA</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Given: A quorum of an assembly of one is such a number as is competent to transact business.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>A quorum measured and accounted of one exists in Tempe, Arizona USA today with primary Director Robert Weber present.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>The primary Director Robert Weber nominates and appoints Robert Weber (same) as President of the Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - Limited, or MMINAIL.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Robert Weber, now as President of the MMINAIL designates Robert Weber (same) as Chairman of the Annual Meeting of the Shareholders of the MMINAIL, this 31st day of December, 2015 at 9:00pm MST.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Robert Weber, as owner of the now US trademarked logo badge and service mark of the MMINAIL and as President of the MMINAIL, in consideration of all current outstanding shares of the MMINAIL, proposes the ownership of the US trademarked logo badge and service mark of the MMINAIL be transferred to the MMINAIL for all current shares of the MMINAIL issued and outstanding since incorporation.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>A vote on the measure now closed passes unanimously.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Therefore, Robert Weber is now the owner of 100% of the current outstanding shares of the MMINAIL and the MMINAIL now owns the US trademarked logo badge and service mark in return.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Robert Weber, as President of the MMINAIL designates Robert Weber (same) as the Secretary of Recording for this meeting.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Robert Weber, as President of the MMINAIL designates Robert Weber (same) as the Treasurer of the MMINAIL and solicits a report from the Treasurer as to the current financial snapshot of the MMINAIL on this date.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>The treasurer’s report now accepted as audited by a committee of one states the sole asset of the MMINAIL at the date of this annual meeting to be the Goodwill value of the now owned US trademarked logo badge and service mark.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>In addition, the accompanying global brand value so generated from current and past social media campaigns, as well as the explicit dollar costs of establishing the corporation, and any costs incurred by then primary Director Robert Weber in the establishment of the MMINAIL as an ongoing entity is hereby noted.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>The costs of establishing the USPTO registered Logo Badge and Service Mark are noted, as well.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>All current outstanding shares of the MMINAIL are hereby designated as Class “A” common shares with a 1:1 ratio of voting rights.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Topic: The original ten-cent par-value of the outstanding Class “A” common shares.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Discussion: The number of shares issued and outstanding at incorporation was 10,000 Class “A” common shares represented by ten certificates of 1,000 shares each of ten-cent par-value Class “A” common.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Those shares now transferred, are now owned by Robert Weber, Owner.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>The market value of the shares now set by the Treasurer is estimated to be $1 USD per Class “A” share on the Equity chart of the balance sheet of the MMINAIL entered as $1,000 par-value and $9,000 Goodwill, Trademarks Owned.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>As the initial sum generated by the issuance of equity shares in effect became an expense of incorporation ($1,000), an offsetting asset of Trademarks Owned is equal to the same net result of incorporation.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Goodwill estimated at 90 cents per share ($9,000) inflates the current Equity chart representing the expected value of the current and past global branding campaigns, and the current and future value of the US trademarked logo badge and service mark going forward.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Appointment of Officers and Directors; Setting of Annual Meeting</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Robert Weber remains as primary Director of the MMINAIL and is now appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of the MMINAIL, as well as President, Treasurer, and now Secretary.</span>
</p>

<p>
