	<span>With today's explosion of modern devices, some consumers like to read their articles on their Kindles or iPads.</span>

	<h4>The A's Have It!</h4>
</hgroup>
	<hr />

<p>
	<span>In today's complicated world of coding, even the use of the standard hyperlink has come into question.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Therefore, to make it easy for the end-user, this User Interface, or <abbr class='oblique-text' title='User Interface'>UI</abbr> will show safe internal links in the bootstrap default color of <span style="color:#337ab7">light dodger blue</span>.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>On the other hand, external links, when designated https secure ...</span> 
	<span>Will be shown in the color of <span style="color:#004B23;">forest green</span>.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>All other external links designated with standard http will be shown in the color of <span style="color:rgb(207,103,75);">indian red</span>.</span>

	<h4>Acronyms</h4>
</hgroup>
	<hr />

<p>
	<span>For an acronym to be visually effective when reading a line of text, the acronym must first be declared.</span> 
</p>

<p>
	<span>In addition, the acronym must stand out from the body of information.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>To accomplsh both of these objectives, the authors have selected <abbr class='oblique-text' title='Ashley Gold: The Stem of the Leaf, a primary color of the registered resident logo badge'>Ashley Gold</abbr>, a primary color within the registered logo badge of the Benefit corporation.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Whenever the end user spies a designated acronym of <abbr class='oblique-text' title='Ashley Gold: The Stem of the Leaf, a primary color of the registered resident logo badge'>Ashley Gold</abbr> color, simply hover over the acronym to reveal the underlying meaning of the acronym letters.</span>

	<hr />

<p>
	<span>This page has been tested for mobile responsiveness on a virtual Galaxy S5 smartphone emulator.</span>
</p>
	<hr />
	
<p>
	<span>The authors have determined the accuracies of the page renderings at both a portrait width of 360px and a landscape width of 640px.</span>
</p>
	<hr />

<p>
	<span>In addition, pages are also tested against an Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7, 3rd Generation tablet.</span>
</p>
	<hr />

<p>
	<span>On the Kindle tablet, both portrait and landscape renderings appear accurate, as well.</span>
</p>
