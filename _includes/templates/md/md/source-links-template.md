# The Shell Project Source Links

Place the introducing line of text ie.) the 'tagline' here ...

## The How

Each **Link Title** is followed by a short statement of critique, followed by a **Live Link**.

In turn, each **Live Link** is followed by **The Code** ( Markdown - Liquid ) required to render the hyperlink.

## Optional Stuff

A short statement of critique, a target, and a title can be added to the sample link, as well.

## Sources and Uses

The source and use of 3rd party materials in the creation of this **Markdown** page is greatly appreciated.

Most authors and publishers will allow for the abbreviated reproduction of their works in part when the case of brief quotations or ideas embodied in critical articles or reviews becomes necessary to further the understanding of the end-user's learning process, and to help subsequently clarify the original thoughts the author is attempting to convey.

Indeed, ping-backs to original sources are welcome by the readers, the authors, and the publishers of instructional hard copies.

Therefore, it is the policy of the **[MMINAIL][1]** to always provide a **Ping Back** to the original author, or to the publisher of the original publication when citing 3rd party work.
