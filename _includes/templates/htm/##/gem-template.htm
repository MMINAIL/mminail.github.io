# Date of this Update to Gem-template file ver 07-29-2017
#
# The Gemfile is where you manage Jekyll versioning.
#
# For example ...
#
# sass "3.4.25"
# 
# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.
#
# Use the following instruction list to instantiate an instance of the Jekyll Server on your development machine ...
#
# First ... you will need to install the 'Ruby Version Manager' onto your development machine.
#
# And, then install a copy of 'Ruby ver 2.4.1' with the help of your new 'Ruby Version Manager'
#
# You will then need to install a copy of the 'Gem Bundler' program using a Terminal command, as follows:
#
# gem install bundler
#
# Once you have successfully installed the 'Gem Bundler' program to your development machine ...
#
# You may run the following command from a Terminal prompt to check the current version installed, as follows:
# 
# bundler --version
#
# And, you may run the following command from a Terminal prompt to check the location of your new Bundler version, as follows:
#
# which bundler
#
# If you need to upgrade your version of the 'Gem Bundler' program, run the following command from a Terminal prompt:
#
# gem update bundler
#
# Once you have successfully installed the 'Gem Bundler' program to your development machine ...
#
# You may now install the local Jekyll Server with the following Terminal command ...
#
# gem install jekyll
#
# Be sure to always preface your work at the Terminal with the following Ruby command:
#
# rvm use 2.4.1
#
# In order to ensure you are working on the correct gem.
#
# Use the following command at the Terminal to double-check ...
#
# which jekyll
#
# Note. You only need to install the Bundler and Jekyll gems one time on your development machine.
#
# It is not necessary to install the Bundler and Jekyll gems every time you create a separate repo. 
#
# A Gemfile ( with no extension ) will be automatically created in the root directory of your new repo.
# 
# If not, create a Gemfile ( with no extension ) and import the contents of this template.
#
# Finally, run the following command from the Terminal prompt of the root directory of your new repo to load the directives of this template.
#
# bundle install
#
# When you want to use a different version of Jekyll, make the changes below.
#
# And, then save the file and run the following command from the Terminal prompt of the root directory of your repo.
#
# bundle update github-pages
#
# Bundler will then install the Jekyll version you have described.
#
# Next, optionally run the command 'jekyll' from the Terminal command line with the command ...
#
# bundle exec jekyll serve
#
# This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is up and running!
#
# To start the Jekyll server, type the following command at the Visual Studio Code integrated terminal window from the /docs directory of your repo:
#
# jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ""
#
# Then, navigate to: http://localhost:4000/ with your browser
#
# Note. The Gemfile and Gemfile dot lock files should be created upon the installation of the Bundler gem.
# 
# The purpose of the Gemfile and Gemfile dot lock files is to inform Bundler about the gem requirements of your GitHub pages website.
# 
# If your website does not have the the Gemfile and Gemfile dot lock files sitting in the root directory of the repo ( NOT in the /docs website subdirectory! ) ...
#
# Then, you can omit the 'bundle exec' command from above and just run the 'jekyll serve' command.
#
# Happy Jekyll-ing!
#
# Note. If you want to use GitHub Pages, comment out the following gem 'jekyll'
#
# gem 'jekyll', '3.4.3'
#
# If you want the option to run Jekyll docs locally ... enable the following line here, and type 'jekyll docs' from the Terminal window of any repo
gem 'jekyll-docs', '3.4.3'
#
# Note. The default theme for new Jekyll sites is 'minima'.
# gem "minima", "~> 2.0"
#
# You may change this to anything you like.
gem "jekyll-theme-cayman"
#
# Note. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages` from the command line.
gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins
#
# If you have any Jekyll plugins, put them here ...
