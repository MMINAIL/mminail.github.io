<p>
  <span>Note. The above excerpts of `markdown` code were written in `markdown`, proofed as a `markdown` file (.md), and then inserted into this `html` (.htm) file.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>GitHub pages (through the Jekyll rendering engine) will first glean the `html`, and then on second pass glean the `markdown`.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>The resultant page will show both the `html` as well as the `markdown` seamlessly as drafted.</span>
