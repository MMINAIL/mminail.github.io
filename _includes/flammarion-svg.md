### Bonus: Flammarion SVG

The **Flammarion** is an ancient portrait of a medieval man poking his head into the ether beyond the then given celestial sphere upon which all planets traversed guided and pulled by Apollo's all powerful Sun Chariot.

The engraving could have been mastered by the 19th century expounder of science, French astronomer Camille Flammarion.

But, more than likely was created by an unknown designer from the 16th century.

Christopher Columbus knew of the value of understanding "the sphere" and put his knowledge of celestial beings to work when unfortunately on his last voyage to the New World he found himself and his crew marooned after battling a late season hurricane.

The ancient Meso-Americans considered an eclipse to be a "bad omen" such that Columbus while shipwrecked used his knowledge of the occurrences of solar eclipses to extract concessions from the natives.

**Note**. The last full eclipse of the sun across America occurred in the year #1979 prior to the ascent of Ronald Reagan's conservative movement and administration.

"If you don't give me and my crew some food, I will cause the sun to stop shining!"~ Christopher Columbus, circa 1500

As if by a miracle, the eclipse came at the exact time Columbus ( and, his star charts ) said it would!

Quite a display of astronomical prowess, heh?

The natives were quite impressed by this feat, and scared, too!

As a result, Columbus and his crew were able to stave off starvation, rebuild their ships, and continue on to the Isthmus of Panama.

### Mascot Badges

**Inline Images** may be displayed in **Markdown** using the exclamation point `!` ...

- Followed by a bracketed `[Alt Text]` ... 

- Followed by a relative `URL` enclosed in a single set of parenthesis `(...)`.

- That includes SVG images, too!

#### Dot ePub

When converting a **Kramdown** md file holding the suffix ( .html ), the ( .mobi ) engine **Dotepub** will return the message [Image in a non-supported format] even though clear as a bell your Chrome browser is rendering the ( .svg ) "No hay problema!"

#### Base Dimensions

Here, we are going to use an original `( .xcf )` file that has been exported from **GIMP** as a `( .psd )` of dimensions 725 px X 725 px X 96 dpi.

#### Import to AI

Next, the resultant `( .psd )` file is imported into **Adobe Illustrator**, or **AI** via simple 'File Open'.

Once inside **AI**, the `( .psd )` file is then "save as" an `( .svg )`.

Out comes a perfectly centered ... to the top horizontal and center vertical ... an `( .svg )` file of initial dimensions 543.75 px X 543.75 px, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
![MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge](../assets/img/svg/MMI-Medmj-Org-Got-Tree-Flammarion-Person-Through-Celestial-Sphere-circle-543-x-543.svg)
{% endraw %}
```

#### Responsive SVG

An **SVG** file can be both expandable and responsive.

To render a smaller version of the `( .svg )`, simply append an appropriate height and width, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
{:height="120px" width="120px"}
{% endraw %}
```

#### Presentation Dimensions

The following **Live** rendition of the **MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge** `( .svg )` image file is set to the dimensions of 500.00 px X 500.00 px, as shown in the following code block:

```liquid
{% raw %}
![MMI™ Flammarion Logo Badge](../assets/img/svg/MMI-Medmj-Org-Got-Tree-Flammarion-Person-Through-Celestial-Sphere-circle-543-x-543.svg){:height="500px" width="500px"}
{% endraw %}
```
