<p>
  <span>Most authors and publishers will allow for the abbreviated reproduction of their works in part.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Especially when the case of brief quotations or ideas embodied in critical articles or reviews becomes necessary
    to further the understanding of the end-user's learning process.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>And, when an effort to subsequently help clarify the original thoughts the author is attempting to convey
    becomes manifest.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Indeed, ping-backs to the original sources are welcome by the readers, the authors, and the publishers of
    instructional hard copies.</span>

<p>
  <span>Therefore, it is the policy of the <abbr class='oblique-text'
