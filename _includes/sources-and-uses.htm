  <span>Most authors and publishers will allow for the abbreviated reproduction of their works in part.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Especially when the case of brief quotations or ideas embodied in critical articles or reviews becomes necessary
    to further the understanding of the end-user's learning process.</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>When an effort to subsequently help clarify the original thoughts the author is attempting to convey
    becomes manifest, a ping-back to the original source(s) is welcome by the readers, the authors, and the publishers
    of instructional hard copies.</span>
