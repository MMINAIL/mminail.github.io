<p>
  <span>In a connective cartography of ideas and hyperlinks spanning the entire connectome of the modern <b>Medical Marijuana Initiative</b> ...</span>
</p>
    
<p>
  <span>The open source authors of this project hope to enlighten the world to the plight of the common medical patient.</span> 
</p>
    
<p>
  <span>Due to a labyrinth of government regulations and costs, today's common medical patient is virtually devoid of healing phyto-cannabinoids and other beneficial terpenes globally for no other reason than his or her current residential address.</span>

</p>
  
<p>
  <span>Doesn't that sound a bit strange to you?</span>
</p>

<p>
  <span>Restricting access to medicine ...</span>
</p>
  
<p>
  <span>Almost Un-constitutional, isn't it?</span>
</p>
  
<p>
  <span>And, with patients in Arizona paying anywhere from $75 to $90 USD for a quarter ounce of medicine ...</span>
</p>
  
<p>
  <span>Don't you think it is time that we allow ALL patients the right to grow, stash, and cure their own medicines?</span>
</p>
