    <span>*** When residing <a href="http://medmj.us/AuthorityToCultivate" title="Click to Review a map of the current Dispensary Cartel locations in Arizona" onclick="javaScript:this.target='_blank';">25 miles extant</a> of a state legalized dispensary ***</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Doesn't that sound a bit strange to you?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Almost Un-constitutional, isn't it?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>And, with patients in Arizona paying anywhere from $75 to $90 USD for a quarter ounce of medicine ...</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>Don't you think it is time that we allow ALL patients the right to grow, stash, and cure their own medicines?</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <span>We do at the <abbr class="oblique-text" title="Medical Marijuana Initiative of North America - International Limited, an Arizona Benefit Corporation">MMINAIL</abbr>.</span>
