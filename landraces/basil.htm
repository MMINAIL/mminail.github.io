<h4>Rama tulsi Basil</h4>
<p>
<span>Indian 'Holy' Basil #1 aka 'Rama tulsi' is the most common form of Indian 'Holy' Basil.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>The 'Rama tulsi' variety of basil forms a dome of small, bluish-green Terpene filled leaves on shrubs and buses about a 1/2 meter tall.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>The leaves of the 'Rama tulsi' basil have a strong camphor scent while emanating simultaneously strong notes of cinnamon.</span>
</p>

<h4>Krishna tulsi Basil</h4>
<p>
<span>Indian 'Holy' Basil #2 aka 'Krishna tulsi' basil has a need for waves of strong summer heat to thrive.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>As a result, the 'Krishna tulsi' variety has smaller leaves than the cooler, wetter weather 'Rama tulsi' variety described above.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>'Krishna tulsi' basil is also distinguished by its reddish-purple stems.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>More peppery than the soft camphor and cinnamon smelling cousin 'Rama tulsi', the 'Krishna tulsi' basil variety offers a greater kick for the crock pot.</span>

<h4>Siam Queen Basil</h4>
<p>
<span>Siam Queen ( Thai Basil ) has a wonderful anise flavor that pairs well with coconut milk.</span>
<span>As anise and pumpkin are two flavors native to Thai cooking, the addition of Thai basil to a coconut milk base when prepared is quite distinctive.</span>
<span>The Thai basil plants grow tall, almost a meter with the crown of the plant spreading about half its length in width.</span>
<span>Colors of the Thai basil are similar to that of the Mexican basil ( see below ), but the Thai basil produces more leaves.</span>
<p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<h4>Purple Opal Basil</h4>
<p>
<span>Purple Opal Basil ( Italian Basil ) has purple leaves and dark purple stems.</span>
<span>As Italian basil is grown for its ornamental color as well as its flavor, the lustrous purple leaves make a nice addition to a salad of light greens.</span>
<span>All basil varieties are sensitive to frost, none more so than the Purple Opal variety, though Italian in origin, nevertheless with roots deep in the tropics, a finicky breed to grow in containers that overnite outside during December's southwest cold dips towards the winter solstice.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>The solution?</span>
<span>Counter-intuitively water less and cover your Purple Opal Basil with sheets of nighttime plastic, stripping the cover when the sun starts to climb towards the noon day apex.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<h4>Lemon Basil</h4>
<p>
<span>Lemon Basil is another favorite breed in the marketplace.</span>
<span>Her basil plants have a pronounced degree of the terpene Limonene.</span>
<span>Sow Lemon basil liberally after all risk of night time and early morning frost is over.</span>
<span>You may notice the diminutive size of her leaves, smaller than most of the other varieties of basil.</span>
<span>Add the fresh Lemon basil leaves and flowers to soups, fish, and seafood dishes for a terpene packed broth of potent medicine.</span>
</p>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<h4>Cinnamon Basil</h4>
<p>
<span>Cinnamon ( Mexican Basil ) is a favorite in most curry dishes.</span>
<span>The leaves of the Mexican basil are half the size of the very green Genovese 'sweet' variety.</span>
<span>If your chef is after a pronounced peppery - cinnamon flavor for your kitchen, Mexican basil is your call.</span>
<span>A kaleidoscope of colors stem from the Mexican basil, from flower bracts of pink to rich, deep purple offerings, the Mexican basil is a striking addition to any edible landscape.</span>
