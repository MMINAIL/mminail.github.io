	<span>Welcome! This is the Square It! ( in Javascript ) page of the <b>Carbon Free Footprint</b> project.</span>

	<h4>Displaying the Program</h4>
</hgroup>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

<p>
	<span>The following code block represents the current version of the subject program written in Javascript by the author(s) at the <a href="https://github.com/rwebaz/" title="Click To Review the Rwebaz repos" target="_blank">Rwebaz</a> repos.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span><b>Note</b>.</span>
	<span>Carriage returns ' ➡️ ' have been added to the code lines when needed to faciliate viewing in a landscape mode on smaller viewports such as smartphones and tablets.</span>
</p>

<pre>
<span>The program as originally written in Javascript, as is ...</span>
{% highlight javascript %}
//Square It
"use strict";
//Declare and assign the arrow function to accept one argument
let SQ = (nbr) => {
  //Set the input variable locally within the function
  var nbr = prompt("Please enter an integer ...")
  /* where nbr = any whole integer */
  //Assign the calculation to a local variable
  var sq = nbr * nbr;
  /* where sq = square of the number */
  //Alert the result to the end-user
  window.alert("The square of the number " ➡️ 
  + nbr + " given is " + sq);
  //Return and archive the result at the console
  return("The square of the input " + nbr + " = " + sq);
};
{% endhighlight %}
</pre>
	<hr class="green-groove" />

	<h4>Rendering the Result</h4>
</hgroup>
	<hr class="green-groove" />
<p>
    <span>Ok ... it's time to give this program a whirl!</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Open up a new window in the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="Click to Download the Current Version of the Firefox Browser" target="_blank">Firefox</a> browser and click on the 'open menu' aka the 'three-bars icon' to the far right of the now unpopulated 'search or enter an address' bar.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Next, select the category 'Developer'.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Finally, select the Web Developer tools submenu by clicking 'Web Console'.</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>You will now wish to go ahead and copy and paste the above code into the program entry line at the bottom of the console.</span> 
</p>

<p>
    <span><b>Note</b>.</span>
    <span>You can also alternatively simply copy and paste the code from the original (.<a href="../js/scripts/square-it.js" title="Click to Review the Original Javascript program file 'square-it'" target="_blank">js</a>) program file, as well.</span>
</p>

<pre>
<span>When entered, the program initially returns ...</span>
{% highlight javascript %}
￩ "use strict"
{% endhighlight %}
</pre>

<p>
	<span>Not to worry ... We are using <a href="#" title="Click to Review EcmaScript 6" target="_blank">EcmaScript 6</a> 'strict mode', so thank you to the Javascript engine for rendering that "use strict" text in the console window!</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>By now, it is the time to type the command needed into the Web Console entry line ( at the bottom of the console ) in order to execute our function SQ in the console window.</span>
</p>

<pre>
<span>Execute the function SQ with an open argument ...</span>
{% highlight javascript %}
//The execution command for the SQ function is ...
SQ();
/* Notice the open argument accepts the prompt nbr */
{% endhighlight %}
</pre>

<p>
	<span>Upon excution, a prompt-box pops up to show the end-user where to enter his or her subject squarable digit(s) ie.) the real number that will be squared by the end-user within the function.</spam>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Upon <code>enter</code>, secondly ... an alert-box pops up to show the end-user what the result of the calculation is!</span>
</p>

<p>
    <span>Finally, to end the function, the result of the calculation is returned to the console as an archive of the activity.</span>
</p>

<pre>
<span>The archive of the activity; where input = 100</span>
{% highlight javascript %}
￩ "square of the input = 10000"
{% endhighlight %}
<span lang="es" title="Sp. 'For Finish'">Finito!</span>&nbsp;...&nbsp;<i class="icon-large icon-flower"></i>
</pre>

<p>
	<span>Whew!</span>
	<span>It takes a lot of time and effort ( not to mention expertise ) ...</span>
